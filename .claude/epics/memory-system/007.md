## Overview
Build comprehensive user interface components for the memory system, including a memory browser for exploring stored memories, settings interface for privacy and preferences, and context visualization components that help users understand and navigate their memory ecosystem.

## Problem Statement
Users need intuitive interfaces to:
- Browse and explore their stored memories effectively
- Configure privacy settings and personal preferences
- Visualize memory relationships and context patterns
- Manage memory lifecycle and organization
- Access memory insights and analytics

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Memory browser UI implemented with search and filtering
- [ ] Settings interface for privacy controls and preferences
- [ ] Context visualization components showing memory relationships
- [ ] Memory management interface (edit, delete, organize)
- [ ] Responsive design working across different screen sizes
- [ ] Accessibility standards met (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Integration with retrieval and management systems complete
- [ ] User testing feedback incorporated

## Technical Requirements

### Memory Browser Components
1. **MemoryList** - Paginated list with filtering and sorting
2. **MemoryCard** - Individual memory display with preview
3. **SearchInterface** - Advanced search with filters and facets
4. **MemoryDetail** - Full memory view with edit capabilities
5. **TagManager** - Visual tag interface with auto-complete

### Settings Interface
1. **PrivacyControls** - Granular privacy setting management
2. **PreferencePanel** - User preference configuration
3. **DataExport** - Memory export and backup interface
4. **IntegrationSettings** - Third-party service configuration
5. **NotificationSettings** - Alert and reminder preferences

### Visualization Components
1. **ContextGraph** - Interactive memory relationship visualization
2. **TimelineView** - Chronological memory navigation
3. **ProjectMap** - Project-based memory organization view
4. **MemoryMetrics** - Usage analytics and insights dashboard
5. **PatternVisualizer** - Memory pattern and trend display

### Design System
- Consistent component library following design tokens
- Dark/light theme support with user preference persistence
- Responsive breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Accessibility features including keyboard navigation and screen readers
- Loading states and error boundaries for robust user experience

## Implementation Notes
- Use component-based architecture for reusability
- Implement lazy loading for performance optimization
- Create comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Build with internationalization support for future localization
- Design for extensibility to support future memory types

## Dependencies
- **003 (Retrieval Engine)**: Required for memory search and filtering
- **005 (Memory Management)**: Required for CRUD operations on memories
- **006 (Privacy & Security)**: Required for privacy controls and data protection

## Parallel Work
Cannot be developed in parallel as it requires completion of retrieval, management, and privacy systems to provide core functionality.

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all UI components
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end tests for complete user workflows
- Accessibility testing with automated tools and manual validation
- Performance testing for large memory collections
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Mobile responsiveness testing

## Documentation Requirements
- Component API documentation
- User interface guidelines
- Accessibility compliance documentation
- Design system documentation
- User guide for memory browser and settings
- Integration guide for connecting with backend systems
