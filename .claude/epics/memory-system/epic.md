# Epic: Memory System

## Overview

Implementation of a comprehensive memory system for Claude Code that enables persistent context across sessions through file-based storage, automated learning from interactions, and intelligent retrieval mechanisms. The system will leverage Claude Code's existing file system capabilities to create a structured knowledge base that improves over time.

## Architecture Decisions

- **Storage Backend**: File-based JSON/Markdown storage in `.claude/memory/` directory for simplicity and transparency
- **Memory Structure**: Hierarchical organization by project → session → interaction for efficient retrieval
- **Integration Pattern**: Event-driven hooks into existing Claude Code tool execution pipeline
- **Context Window Management**: Smart summarization and pruning to respect token limits
- **Privacy Model**: Local storage with explicit user control and opt-out mechanisms
- **Retrieval Strategy**: Semantic similarity + recency + frequency scoring for relevance ranking

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **Memory Status Indicator**: Visual feedback on memory state and learning progress
- **Memory Browser UI**: Interface to explore, edit, and manage stored memories
- **Privacy Controls**: Granular settings for what gets remembered and shared
- **Context Visualization**: Display of relevant retrieved context before responses
- **Memory Export/Import**: Tools for sharing and backing up memory data

### Backend Services
- **Memory Storage Engine**: Core CRUD operations for memory persistence
  - JSON-based storage for structured data
  - Markdown storage for contextual narratives
  - File-based indexing for efficient retrieval
- **Learning Pipeline**: Automatic extraction of patterns and insights
  - Interaction success pattern detection
  - User preference inference from corrections
  - Code pattern and architectural decision capture
- **Retrieval Engine**: Context-aware memory lookup
  - Semantic similarity matching
  - Temporal relevance scoring
  - Project-specific context filtering
- **Memory Management**: Capacity handling and optimization
  - Intelligent pruning of outdated information
  - Compression of similar memories
  - Backup and recovery mechanisms

### Infrastructure
- **File System Organization**:
  ```
  .claude/memory/
  ├── projects/[project-id]/
  │   ├── context.json
  │   ├── patterns/
  │   ├── decisions/
  │   └── preferences.json
  ├── global/
  │   ├── user-preferences.json
  │   └── cross-project-patterns/
  └── indices/
      ├── semantic-index.json
      └── temporal-index.json
  ```
- **Performance Optimization**: In-memory caching of frequently accessed memories
- **Monitoring**: Memory usage metrics, retrieval performance, learning effectiveness
- **Security**: Sensitive data filtering, privacy controls, secure storage practices

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-2)
- **Core Storage System**: Basic memory CRUD operations
- **Simple Context Persistence**: Project structure and basic preferences
- **Integration Hooks**: Event listeners for tool execution and user interactions
- **Basic Retrieval**: Simple keyword-based memory lookup

### Phase 2: Learning Intelligence (Months 3-4)
- **Pattern Recognition**: Automated detection of code patterns and architectural decisions
- **User Preference Learning**: Inference from user corrections and choices
- **Smart Retrieval**: Semantic similarity and relevance scoring
- **Memory Organization**: Hierarchical structuring and categorization

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Months 5-6)
- **Team Memory Sharing**: Collaborative memory with conflict resolution
- **Advanced UI**: Memory browser and management interface
- **Cross-Project Learning**: Pattern transfer between projects
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching, indexing, and pruning improvements

### Phase 4: Enterprise & Polish (Months 7+)
- **Advanced Privacy Controls**: Fine-grained permission management
- **Enterprise Integration**: Team dashboards and administrative controls
- **Advanced Analytics**: Learning effectiveness metrics and insights
- **Scalability Improvements**: Support for large teams and codebases

### Risk Mitigation
- **Privacy Risks**: Start with explicit opt-in and transparent storage
- **Performance Risks**: Implement lazy loading and efficient indexing from day one
- **Accuracy Risks**: Include memory validation and correction mechanisms
- **Complexity Risks**: Begin with MVP and iterate based on user feedback

### Testing Approach
- **Unit Testing**: Core storage, retrieval, and learning algorithms
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end memory persistence across sessions
- **Performance Testing**: Memory retrieval latency and storage efficiency
- **User Testing**: Memory relevance and learning accuracy validation
