## Overview
Implement an intelligent memory management system that organizes memories by relevance and age, automatically prunes outdated or less useful information, and handles storage capacity constraints through smart compression and archival strategies.

## Problem Statement
As the memory system accumulates data over time, it needs intelligent management to maintain performance and relevance. Without proper management:
- Memory collections grow indefinitely, impacting search performance
- Outdated information clutters search results
- Storage capacity becomes a limiting factor
- Memory quality degrades over time without curation
- System performance decreases as data volume increases

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Memory organization system categorizes and prioritizes stored information
- [ ] Intelligent pruning algorithms remove outdated and irrelevant memories
- [ ] Capacity management system handles storage limits gracefully
- [ ] Memory compression reduces storage requirements without losing quality
- [ ] Archival system preserves important historical information
- [ ] Performance optimization maintains fast search and retrieval
- [ ] Memory quality metrics track and improve system effectiveness

## Technical Requirements

### Memory Organization
1. **Relevance-Based Classification**
   - Automatic categorization by topic and context
   - Importance scoring based on usage and outcomes
   - Relationship mapping between related memories
   - Dynamic re-organization as patterns emerge

2. **Temporal Organization**
   - Age-based memory lifecycle management
   - Recency vs. relevance balancing
   - Seasonal pattern recognition and preservation
   - Historical significance identification

3. **Usage-Based Organization**
   - Access frequency tracking and optimization
   - User interaction pattern recognition
   - Popular memory promotion and caching
   - Unused memory identification for pruning

### Core Components
1. **MemoryOrganizer** - Categorizes and structures memory collections
2. **PruningEngine** - Identifies and removes obsolete memories
3. **CapacityManager** - Monitors and manages storage constraints
4. **CompressionSystem** - Optimizes memory storage efficiency
5. **ArchivalManager** - Preserves important historical data
6. **QualityMonitor** - Tracks and improves memory system effectiveness

### Memory Lifecycle Management
```json
{
  "memoryId": "uuid",
  "lifecycle": {
    "created": "ISO-8601",
    "last_accessed": "ISO-8601",
    "access_count": "number",
    "relevance_score": "0.0-1.0",
    "importance": "low|medium|high|critical",
    "status": "active|archived|pruned",
    "expiry_candidate": "boolean",
    "compression_level": "none|light|medium|heavy"
  },
  "relationships": {
    "related_memories": ["memory-ids"],
    "dependency_level": "standalone|referenced|core",
    "cluster_id": "uuid"
  }
}
```

### Pruning Algorithms
1. **Age-Based Pruning**
   - Configurable retention periods by memory type
   - Importance-weighted age calculation
   - Usage pattern consideration for age overrides

2. **Relevance-Based Pruning**
   - Low-relevance memory identification
   - Duplicate content detection and merging
   - Outdated information recognition

3. **Capacity-Driven Pruning**
   - LRU (Least Recently Used) algorithms
   - Storage impact vs. value analysis
   - Critical memory preservation

## Implementation Notes

### Memory Organization Strategy
```javascript
// Example organization algorithm
function organizeMemories(memories) {
  const organized = {
    byTopic: clusterByTopic(memories),
    byProject: groupByProject(memories),
    byImportance: rankByImportance(memories),
    byUsage: sortByUsageFrequency(memories)
  };
  
  return optimizeForRetrieval(organized);
}
```

### Intelligent Pruning Logic
```javascript
function shouldPruneMemory(memory, context) {
  const factors = {
    age: calculateAgeScore(memory.created),
    relevance: calculateRelevanceScore(memory, context),
    usage: calculateUsageScore(memory.access_count, memory.last_accessed),
    importance: memory.importance_weight,
    dependencies: countReferences(memory.id)
  };
  
  return weightedPruningDecision(factors);
}
```

### Compression Strategies
1. **Content Compression**
   - Lossless compression for exact content preservation
   - Semantic compression for summarizable content
   - Reference deduplication for repeated information

2. **Metadata Optimization**
   - Index compression for faster search
   - Relationship graph optimization
   - Redundant metadata elimination

3. **Archival Compression**
   - Heavy compression for rarely accessed memories
   - Batch compression for efficiency
   - Searchable archive indices

## Dependencies
- **001 (Storage Foundation)**: Required for file system operations and storage management
- **003 (Basic Retrieval)**: Needed for accessing memory usage patterns and search optimization

## Parallel Work
Can be developed alongside learning pipeline (004) since they operate on similar data but serve different purposes.

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for pruning algorithms and organization logic
- Integration tests for capacity management scenarios
- Performance tests for large memory collections and pruning operations
- Data integrity tests for compression and archival processes
- Edge case testing (storage failures, corruption, extreme capacity limits)
- User impact testing for pruning accuracy and system performance

## Technical Challenges
1. **Pruning Accuracy**: Avoiding deletion of important memories
2. **Performance**: Maintaining fast operations during management processes
3. **Storage Efficiency**: Balancing compression with accessibility
4. **Data Integrity**: Ensuring reliability during reorganization and pruning
5. **User Experience**: Transparent management without disrupting workflows
6. **Scalability**: Handling growing memory collections efficiently

## Management Metrics
- Memory collection size and growth rate
- Pruning accuracy and false positive rates
- Compression ratio and retrieval speed impact
- Storage capacity utilization and efficiency
- System performance before and after management operations
- User satisfaction with memory availability and relevance

## Configuration Options
```json
{
  "retention_periods": {
    "interactions": "90 days",
    "patterns": "1 year",
    "preferences": "permanent",
    "temporary_context": "7 days"
