## Overview
Implement comprehensive team memory sharing mechanisms that enable collaborative knowledge management across team members. This includes shared memory spaces, conflict resolution systems, collaborative knowledge base features, and team-based memory governance.

## Problem Statement
Teams need the ability to:
- Share relevant memories and knowledge across team members
- Maintain consistency and avoid conflicts in shared memory spaces
- Collaborate on building institutional knowledge bases
- Control access and permissions for sensitive information
- Resolve conflicts when multiple team members modify shared memories

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Team memory sharing infrastructure implemented
- [ ] Conflict resolution system for concurrent memory modifications
- [ ] Collaborative knowledge base with version control
- [ ] Team permission and access control system
- [ ] Memory synchronization across team members
- [ ] Team memory governance and moderation tools
- [ ] Integration with existing team communication tools
- [ ] Audit trail for team memory changes

## Technical Requirements

### Sharing Infrastructure
1. **TeamMemoryManager** - Central coordination for team memory operations
2. **SharingProtocol** - Standardized memory sharing format and API
3. **SynchronizationEngine** - Real-time memory sync across team members
4. **ConflictResolver** - Automatic and manual conflict resolution
5. **AccessController** - Permission-based memory access management

### Collaborative Features
1. **SharedWorkspace** - Team-specific memory collections
2. **CollaborativeEditor** - Multi-user memory editing with live updates
3. **VersionHistory** - Complete audit trail of memory changes
4. **CommentSystem** - Memory annotation and discussion threads
5. **NotificationService** - Team activity and change notifications

### Knowledge Base System
1. **KnowledgeOrganizer** - Hierarchical knowledge structure management
2. **ContentCurator** - Quality control and memory validation
3. **SearchFederation** - Cross-team memory discovery
4. **TemplateManager** - Standardized memory templates for teams
5. **ExpertiseMapper** - Team member expertise and memory attribution

### Governance Tools
1. **ModerationInterface** - Team memory governance dashboard
2. **PolicyEngine** - Configurable sharing and access policies
3. **ComplianceMonitor** - Regulatory and policy compliance checking
4. **DataGovernor** - Data retention and lifecycle management
5. **ReportingSystem** - Team memory usage and governance reporting

## Implementation Notes
- Design for high availability and fault tolerance
- Implement optimistic concurrency control for performance
- Use event-driven architecture for real-time updates
- Create comprehensive API documentation for third-party integrations
- Build with scalability considerations for large teams

## Dependencies
- **005 (Memory Management)**: Required for core memory operations
- **006 (Privacy & Security)**: Required for access control and data protection

## Parallel Work
Can be developed in parallel with UI components (007) and performance optimization (009) as it operates at a different architectural layer.

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all sharing and collaboration components
- Integration tests for multi-user scenarios
- Conflict resolution testing with simulated concurrent access
- Performance testing under high collaboration load
- Security testing for access control and data protection
- End-to-end testing of team workflows
- Load testing for team synchronization at scale

## Documentation Requirements
- Team sharing API documentation
- Conflict resolution algorithm documentation
- Access control and permissions guide
- Team onboarding and setup guide
- Best practices for collaborative memory management
- Integration guide for team communication tools
- Governance and compliance documentation
