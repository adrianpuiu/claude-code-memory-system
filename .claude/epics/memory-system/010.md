## Overview
Integrate the memory system with existing Claude Code architecture and create a comprehensive deployment pipeline with rollout strategy, monitoring, and feature flags for gradual production rollout.

## Problem Statement

   - Implement memory initialization in application startup
   - Wire conversation context to memory retrieval
   - Test integration with existing conversation flows

2. **Configuration Management**
   - Extend existing config system for memory settings
   - Implement environment-specific memory configurations
   - Create default memory policies for different user tiers
   - Validate configuration loading and validation

### Phase 2: Deployment Infrastructure (6 hours)
1. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Extend existing pipeline to include memory components
   - Add memory-specific test suites to pipeline
   - Implement database migration testing
   - Create deployment artifacts and versioning

2. **Environment Setup**
   - Configure staging environment with memory system
   - Set up production-ready database configurations
   - Implement backup and recovery procedures
   - Test deployment and rollback procedures

### Phase 3: Feature Management (4 hours)
1. **Feature Flags Implementation**
   - Integrate feature flag service (LaunchDarkly/similar)
   - Implement memory-specific feature toggles
   - Create user segmentation logic
   - Test flag changes without deployments

2. **Rollout Strategy**
   - Define rollout phases and success criteria
   - Implement gradual user enablement
   - Create rollback triggers and procedures
   - Test emergency shutdown capabilities

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Launch (6 hours)
1. **Observability Setup**
   - Configure logging aggregation (ELK/similar)
   - Set up metrics collection (Prometheus/similar)
   - Create alerting rules and runbooks
   - Implement performance dashboards

2. **Production Launch**
   - Execute controlled production deployment
   - Monitor initial user cohort closely
   - Validate all systems operating correctly
   - Execute gradual rollout plan

## Technical Specifications

### Integration Points
```typescript
// Main application integration
interface MemoryIntegration {
  initializeMemory(config: MemoryConfig): Promise<void>
  enhanceConversation(request: ConversationRequest): Promise<EnhancedRequest>
  persistConversation(response: ConversationResponse): Promise<void>
  retrieveContext(sessionId: string): Promise<ConversationContext>
}

// Feature flag integration  
interface MemoryFeatureFlags {
  isMemoryEnabled(userId: string): boolean
  getMemoryCapabilities(userId: string): MemoryCapabilities
  shouldUseAdvancedRetrieval(sessionId: string): boolean
  canAccessLongTermMemory(userId: string): boolean
}
```

### Deployment Configuration
```yaml
# Deployment pipeline stages
stages:
  - validate
  - test
  - build
  - deploy-staging
  - integration-tests
  - deploy-production
  - post-deployment-tests
  - gradual-rollout

# Feature flag configuration
memory_system:
  enabled: false
  rollout_percentage: 0
  user_segments:
