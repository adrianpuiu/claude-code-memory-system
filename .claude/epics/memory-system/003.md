## Overview
Implement a basic but effective memory search and retrieval system that can find relevant memories using keyword matching and simple relevance scoring. This system will enable the memory system to surface useful context and previous interactions to inform current responses.

## Problem Statement
Without a retrieval system, stored memories are effectively useless. The system needs to:
- Quickly locate relevant memories based on current context
- Rank results by relevance and recency
- Surface the most useful information for response generation
- Handle queries with varying levels of specificity
- Scale efficiently as memory collection grows

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Keyword-based search functionality working across all memory types
- [ ] Basic relevance scoring algorithm implemented and tuned
- [ ] Context injection system delivers relevant memories to responses
- [ ] Search performance acceptable for real-time use
- [ ] Memory ranking prioritizes most useful information
- [ ] Query expansion handles related terms and concepts
- [ ] Search results formatted for easy consumption

## Technical Requirements

### Search Functionality
1. **Keyword Matching**
   - Full-text search across memory content
   - Metadata field searching (tags, categories, timestamps)
   - Fuzzy matching for typos and variations
   - Boolean query support (AND, OR, NOT)

2. **Relevance Scoring**
   - TF-IDF scoring for content relevance
   - Recency weighting (newer memories score higher)
   - Context similarity scoring
   - User interaction frequency weighting

3. **Context Injection**
   - Automatic relevant memory discovery
   - Response-time memory integration
   - Context size optimization
   - Relevance threshold filtering

### Core Components
1. **SearchEngine** - Main query processing interface
2. **IndexManager** - Efficient memory indexing for fast search
3. **RelevanceScorer** - Ranking algorithm implementation
4. **ContextInjector** - Memory integration with responses
5. **QueryProcessor** - Query parsing and expansion

### Search Index Structure
```json
{
  "memoryId": "uuid",
  "content": "indexed-text",
  "metadata": {
    "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
    "project": "project-id",
    "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
    "type": "interaction|context|pattern",
    "importance": "low|medium|high|critical"
  },
  "vectors": {
    "keywords": ["extracted", "keywords"],
    "concepts": ["identified", "concepts"],
    "entities": ["named", "entities"]
  }
}
```

### Relevance Scoring Algorithm
```javascript
function calculateRelevance(memory, query, context) {
  const scores = {
    content: tfIdfScore(memory.content, query),
    recency: recencyScore(memory.timestamp),
    context: contextSimilarity(memory.context, context),
    interaction: interactionFrequency(memory.id),
    importance: importanceWeight(memory.metadata.importance)
  };
  
  return weightedSum(scores, RELEVANCE_WEIGHTS);
}
```

## Implementation Notes

### Search Performance Optimizations
- Inverted index for fast keyword lookup
- Memory content preprocessing and caching
- Incremental index updates for new memories
- Query result caching for common searches
- Lazy loading for large result sets

### Query Processing Pipeline
1. **Parse**: Extract keywords, operators, and filters
2. **Expand**: Add synonyms and related terms
3. **Search**: Execute against memory index
4. **Score**: Apply relevance ranking algorithm
5. **Filter**: Apply threshold and context filters
6. **Format**: Prepare results for consumption

### Integration Points
- Automatic query generation from user messages
- Response enrichment with relevant memories
- Proactive memory suggestion for related topics
- Memory validation based on current context

## Dependencies
- **001 (Storage Foundation)**: Required for reading stored memories and maintaining search indices

## Parallel Work
Can be developed alongside context capture system (002) since it operates on existing stored data.

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for search algorithms and scoring functions
- Integration tests with various memory types and sizes
- Performance tests with large memory collections
- Relevance accuracy tests with known good/bad matches
- Edge case testing (empty queries, no matches, large result sets)
- User experience testing for search response times

## Technical Challenges
1. **Performance**: Fast search across growing memory collections
2. **Relevance**: Accurate ranking without complex ML models
3. **Scalability**: Maintaining performance as data volume increases
4. **Integration**: Seamless memory injection without disrupting responses
5. **Precision**: Balancing recall and precision in search results

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)
- Semantic search using embedding models
- Learning from user feedback on search quality
- Advanced query understanding and expansion
- Memory clustering and topic detection
- Collaborative filtering based on similar users

## Documentation Requirements
- Search query syntax guide
- Relevance scoring algorithm documentation
- Performance tuning guide
- Integration examples for response enhancement
- Troubleshooting guide for search issues
