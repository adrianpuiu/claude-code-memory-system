## Overview
Implement a comprehensive privacy and security framework that provides user controls over memory collection and usage, filters sensitive data automatically, ensures secure storage practices, and maintains strict data isolation between projects and users.

## Problem Statement
The memory system handles potentially sensitive user data, code, and interactions that require robust privacy and security protections. Without proper safeguards:
- Sensitive information could be inadvertently stored or exposed
- Users lack control over what data is collected and how it's used
- Cross-project data leakage could expose confidential information
- Stored memories could become a security vulnerability
- Compliance with privacy regulations may be compromised

## Success Criteria
- [ ] User consent and control mechanisms fully functional
- [ ] Automatic sensitive data detection and filtering working
- [ ] Secure storage encryption and access controls implemented
- [ ] Data isolation between projects and users enforced
- [ ] Privacy policy compliance and audit trail system operational
- [ ] User data export and deletion capabilities working
- [ ] Security vulnerability assessment and mitigation complete

## Technical Requirements

### Privacy Controls
1. **User Consent Management**
   - Granular permission settings for data collection types
   - Opt-in/opt-out mechanisms for specific memory features
   - Consent tracking and audit trail maintenance
   - Easy privacy settings configuration and modification

2. **Data Collection Controls**
   - Selective memory capture based on user preferences
   - Context-sensitive privacy settings
   - Temporary mode for sensitive work sessions
   - Emergency privacy lockdown capabilities

3. **Data Usage Transparency**
   - Clear documentation of what data is collected and how
   - User dashboard showing stored memory summary
   - Data retention policy enforcement
   - Regular privacy impact assessments

### Core Components
1. **ConsentManager** - Handles user permission and consent tracking
2. **SensitiveDataFilter** - Automatically identifies and handles sensitive information
3. **SecureStorage** - Implements encryption and secure storage practices
4. **DataIsolation** - Enforces separation between projects and users
5. **PrivacyAuditor** - Monitors and audits privacy compliance
6. **DataPortability** - Enables user data export and deletion

### Sensitive Data Detection
```json
{
  "detection_rules": {
    "credentials": {
      "patterns": ["password", "api_key", "secret", "token"],
      "regex": ["\\b[A-Za-z0-9+/]{20,}={0,2}\\b"],
      "action": "redact|exclude|encrypt"
    },
    "personal_info": {
      "patterns": ["email", "phone", "ssn", "address"],
      "context_aware": true,
      "action": "anonymize|exclude"
    },
    "financial": {
      "patterns": ["credit_card", "bank_account", "routing_number"],
      "validation": true,
      "action": "exclude"
    }
  }
}
```

### Security Architecture
1. **Encryption at Rest**
   - AES-256 encryption for all stored memory files
   - Separate encryption keys per user/project
   - Key derivation from user credentials or system keys
   - Secure key storage and rotation

2. **Access Control**
   - User authentication and authorization
   - Project-based access permissions
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Session management and timeout

3. **Data Isolation**
   - Strict project boundary enforcement
   - User data separation guarantees
   - Secure multi-tenancy architecture
   - Cross-contamination prevention

## Implementation Notes

### Sensitive Data Filtering Pipeline
```javascript
// Example sensitive data detection
function filterSensitiveData(content, context) {
  const filters = [
    credentialFilter,
    personalInfoFilter,
    financialDataFilter,
    contextSpecificFilters(context)
  ];
  
  return filters.reduce((filtered, filter) => {
    return filter.apply(filtered);
  }, content);
}
```

### Encryption Implementation
```javascript
// Example storage encryption
class SecureMemoryStorage {
  constructor(userKey) {
    this.encryptionKey = deriveKey(userKey);
  }
  
  async storeMemory(memory) {
    const encrypted = await encrypt(JSON.stringify(memory), this.encryptionKey);
    return writeSecureFile(encrypted, memory.id);
  }
  
  async retrieveMemory(memoryId) {
    const encrypted = await readSecureFile(memoryId);
    const decrypted = await decrypt(encrypted, this.encryptionKey);
    return JSON.parse(decrypted);
  }
}
```

### Privacy Control Schema
```json
{
  "userId": "uuid",
  "privacy_settings": {
    "memory_collection": {
      "interactions": "enabled|disabled|selective",
      "code_changes": "enabled|disabled|anonymous",
      "tool_usage": "enabled|disabled|minimal"
    },
    "data_retention": {
      "max_age": "90 days",
      "auto_prune": true,
      "preserve_patterns": false
    },
    "sharing": {
      "cross_project": false,
      "anonymized_analytics": true,
      "improvement_feedback": "opt-in"
    },
    "sensitive_data": {
      "auto_detection": true,
      "custom_patterns": ["custom-regex-patterns"],
      "redaction_level": "partial|full|exclude"
    }
  }
}
```

## Dependencies
- **001 (Storage Foundation)**: Required for implementing secure storage mechanisms and encryption

## Parallel Work
Can be developed alongside other components since privacy and security are cross-cutting concerns that need to be integrated throughout the system.

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for sensitive data detection algorithms
- Integration tests for encryption and decryption processes
- Security penetration testing for access controls
- Privacy compliance testing with various user settings
- Data isolation testing to prevent cross-contamination
- Performance tests for encryption overhead
- User experience tests for privacy control usability

## Technical Challenges
1. **Detection Accuracy**: Balancing false positives/negatives in sensitive data detection
2. **Performance Impact**: Minimizing encryption/filtering overhead on system performance
3. **Key Management**: Secure key storage and rotation without user complexity
4. **Compliance**: Meeting various privacy regulation requirements (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
5. **Usability**: Making privacy controls accessible without overwhelming users
6. **Recovery**: Handling encryption key loss and data recovery scenarios

## Security Measures
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments
- Secure coding practices and code review processes
- Encryption key rotation and management
- Access logging and anomaly detection
- Incident response procedures for data breaches
- Regular backup and recovery testing

## Privacy Compliance
- GDPR compliance for European users
- CCPA compliance for California residents
- SOC 2 Type II compliance considerations
- Regular privacy impact assessments
- Data processing agreement templates
- User rights fulfillment (access, rectification, erasure, portability)
