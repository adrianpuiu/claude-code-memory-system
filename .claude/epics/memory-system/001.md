## Overview
Establish the foundational storage infrastructure for the memory system. This task creates the core directory structure, implements basic file operations for JSON and Markdown persistence, and sets up project identification and memory organization capabilities.

## Problem Statement
The memory system requires a robust, organized storage foundation that can:
- Persist memories across sessions in a structured format
- Organize memories by project and context
- Support both structured (JSON) and unstructured (Markdown) data
- Provide reliable file system operations with proper error handling

## Success Criteria
- [ ] `.claude/memory/` directory structure created and functional
- [ ] JSON file operations (read/write/update) working reliably
- [ ] Markdown file operations supporting metadata frontmatter
- [ ] Project identification system implemented
- [ ] Memory organization by project/context working
- [ ] File system error handling robust and user-friendly
- [ ] Storage configuration documented and testable

## Technical Requirements

### Directory Structure
```
.claude/
└── memory/
    ├── projects/
    │   └── {project-id}/
    │       ├── context/
    │       ├── interactions/
    │       └── metadata.json
    ├── global/
    │   ├── patterns/
    │   └── preferences/
    └── config.json
```

### Core Components
1. **StorageManager** - Central file system interface
2. **ProjectIdentifier** - Unique project identification
3. **MemoryOrganizer** - Context-based memory organization
4. **FileOperations** - JSON/Markdown read/write utilities

### File Formats
- **JSON**: Structured data with schema validation
- **Markdown**: Frontmatter + content for rich text storage
- **Configuration**: Global settings and project mappings

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when storage unavailable
- Automatic directory creation
- File permission validation
- Corruption detection and recovery

## Implementation Notes
- Use atomic file operations to prevent corruption
- Implement proper file locking for concurrent access
- Create comprehensive file validation
- Support both relative and absolute project paths
- Design for cross-platform compatibility

## Dependencies
None - This is a foundational component

## Parallel Work
Can be developed alongside basic retrieval engine (003) since they share similar file operation requirements.

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all file operations
- Integration tests for directory structure creation
- Error condition testing (permissions, disk space, corruption)
- Cross-platform compatibility tests
- Performance tests for large memory collections

## Documentation Requirements
- File format specifications
- Directory structure documentation
- Configuration guide
- Error handling guide
- Migration strategy for future schema changes
