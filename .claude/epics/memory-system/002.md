## Overview
Implement an automated system for capturing and extracting meaningful context from project interactions and tool executions. This system will serve as the primary data source for the memory system by monitoring user activities, tool usage patterns, and project evolution.

## Problem Statement
The memory system needs rich, contextual data to be useful. Currently, there's no systematic way to:
- Capture user interactions and their intent
- Extract meaningful context from tool executions
- Track project evolution and decision patterns
- Build a comprehensive understanding of user workflows

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Event hooks integrated with all major tool executions
- [ ] Context extraction algorithms identify key information
- [ ] Interaction logging captures user intent and outcomes
- [ ] Project state tracking monitors significant changes
- [ ] Context enrichment adds semantic meaning to raw events
- [ ] Performance impact minimal on normal operations
- [ ] Privacy controls allow selective context capture

## Technical Requirements

### Event System
1. **Tool Execution Hooks**
   - Pre/post execution event capture
   - Parameter and result logging
   - Error condition tracking
   - Performance metrics collection

2. **Context Extraction Algorithms**
   - Intent inference from user messages
   - Code change pattern analysis
   - File relationship mapping
   - Decision point identification

3. **Interaction Logging**
   - User message classification
   - Response effectiveness tracking
   - Follow-up pattern analysis
   - Context continuity mapping

### Data Capture Points
- **User Messages**: Intent, domain, complexity, follow-ups
- **Tool Executions**: Type, parameters, success/failure, duration
- **Code Changes**: Files modified, patterns, scope, impact
- **Project Evolution**: Structure changes, dependency updates, configurations
- **Error Patterns**: Common failures, resolution strategies, prevention

### Context Enrichment
- **Semantic Tagging**: Categorize interactions by purpose
- **Relationship Mapping**: Connect related interactions and outcomes
- **Pattern Detection**: Identify recurring workflows and preferences
- **Impact Analysis**: Track consequences of decisions and changes

## Implementation Notes

### Event Hook Integration
```javascript
// Example hook structure
toolHooks.register('pre-execution', (toolName, params) => {
  contextCapture.recordToolStart(toolName, params, getUserContext());
});

toolHooks.register('post-execution', (toolName, result, error) => {
  contextCapture.recordToolComplete(toolName, result, error, getExecutionContext());
});
```

### Context Data Schema
```json
{
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "sessionId": "uuid",
  "userId": "string",
  "project": {
    "id": "string",
    "path": "string",
    "type": "detected-type"
  },
  "interaction": {
    "type": "user-message|tool-execution|system-event",
    "content": "processed-content",
    "intent": "extracted-intent",
    "context": "surrounding-context"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "tags": ["array", "of", "tags"],
    "relationships": ["related-interaction-ids"],
    "importance": "low|medium|high|critical"
  }
}
```

### Privacy and Performance
- Configurable capture levels (minimal, standard, detailed)
- Opt-out mechanisms for sensitive operations
- Data anonymization options
- Efficient storage to minimize disk usage
- Background processing to avoid UI blocking

## Dependencies
- **001 (Storage Foundation)**: Required for persistent storage of captured context

## Parallel Work
Cannot run in parallel - depends on storage foundation being established first.

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual context extraction algorithms
- Integration tests with various tool combinations
- Performance tests under high-frequency usage
- Privacy compliance tests
- Edge case testing (network issues, storage failures)
- User experience testing for performance impact

## Technical Challenges
1. **Performance**: Minimizing overhead on normal operations
2. **Privacy**: Balancing useful context with user privacy
3. **Scale**: Handling large volumes of interaction data
4. **Accuracy**: Extracting meaningful context from diverse interactions
5. **Storage**: Efficient persistence without bloating disk usage

## Documentation Requirements
- Context capture configuration guide
- Privacy and data handling policies
- Performance tuning recommendations
- Context extraction algorithm documentation
- Integration guide for new tools and hooks
