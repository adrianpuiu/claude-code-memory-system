# PRD: Memory System

## Problem Statement

Currently, Claude Code lacks persistent memory across sessions, leading to:
- Repeated discovery of project structure and patterns
- Loss of context about previous decisions and approaches
- Inefficient re-learning of codebase specifics
- Inconsistent responses for similar queries across sessions
- Need to re-establish project conventions and preferences

## Vision

Create a comprehensive memory system that enables Claude Code to:
- Retain context about projects, codebases, and user preferences
- Learn and remember patterns, conventions, and decisions
- Provide consistent, contextually-aware responses across sessions
- Reduce time spent on project discovery and setup
- Build cumulative knowledge about development workflows

## Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Context Persistence**: Maintain project context across sessions
2. **Learning Accumulation**: Build knowledge base from interactions
3. **Consistency**: Provide coherent responses based on historical context
4. **Efficiency**: Reduce redundant discovery and setup time

### Secondary Goals
1. **User Preference Learning**: Remember user coding styles and preferences
2. **Project Pattern Recognition**: Identify and remember architectural patterns
3. **Decision History**: Track and recall previous technical decisions
4. **Knowledge Sharing**: Enable insights from one project to inform others

## User Stories

### As a Developer
- I want Claude Code to remember my project's architecture so I don't have to re-explain it each session
- I want Claude Code to recall previous decisions and their rationale
- I want Claude Code to learn my coding preferences and apply them consistently
- I want Claude Code to remember which files and components are most important in my project
- I want Claude Code to understand the testing patterns I prefer

### As a Team Lead
- I want Claude Code to maintain knowledge about our team conventions
- I want Claude Code to remember our architectural decisions and standards
- I want Claude Code to recall our deployment and CI/CD patterns
- I want Claude Code to understand our code review and quality standards

### As a Project Manager
- I want visibility into what Claude Code has learned about our project
- I want the ability to review and validate remembered decisions
- I want to ensure sensitive information is handled appropriately in memory

## Functional Requirements

### F1: Context Storage
- Store project-specific context including architecture, patterns, and conventions
- Maintain file structure understanding and component relationships
- Remember user preferences and coding styles
- Preserve decision history with rationale

### F2: Memory Retrieval
- Efficiently retrieve relevant context for current tasks
- Prioritize recent and frequently accessed information
- Provide contextually appropriate responses based on stored knowledge
- Surface relevant past decisions and patterns

### F3: Learning System
- Automatically capture insights from successful interactions
- Learn from user corrections and feedback
- Identify and remember recurring patterns
- Build knowledge incrementally over time

### F4: Memory Management
- Organize memory by project, timeframe, and relevance
- Provide mechanisms to review and edit stored memories
- Handle memory capacity limitations gracefully
- Support memory export and import for project sharing

### F5: Privacy and Security
- Ensure sensitive information is handled appropriately
- Provide user control over what gets remembered
- Support memory deletion and cleanup
- Maintain data isolation between different projects/users

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Memory retrieval should add minimal latency to responses
- Memory storage should not significantly impact session performance
- System should handle large codebases efficiently

### Reliability
- Memory should persist reliably across sessions and system restarts
- System should gracefully handle memory corruption or loss
- Backup and recovery mechanisms should be in place

### Scalability
- Support multiple concurrent projects with isolated memory
- Handle growing memory size without performance degradation
- Support team-shared memory when appropriate

### Usability
- Memory operations should be transparent to users
- Provide visibility into what has been learned and remembered
- Allow user control over memory behavior

## Technical Constraints

- Must integrate with existing Claude Code architecture
- Should leverage existing file system and tool capabilities
- Must respect Claude's context window limitations
- Should work within current security and privacy frameworks
- Must be backward compatible with existing workflows

## Success Criteria

### Immediate Success (1-3 months)
- Basic context persistence across sessions works reliably
- Users report reduced need to re-explain project structure
- Common patterns and preferences are learned and applied
- Memory retrieval improves response relevance

### Long-term Success (6-12 months)
- Significant reduction in project onboarding time
- Users report consistent, contextually-aware responses
- Accumulated knowledge improves code quality suggestions
- Team-shared memory enhances collaboration

### Metrics
- **Context Retention Rate**: % of important context maintained across sessions
- **Response Relevance**: User satisfaction with contextually-informed responses
- **Setup Time Reduction**: Time saved in project discovery per session
- **Learning Accuracy**: Correctness of learned patterns and preferences
- **User Adoption**: % of users actively using memory features

## Risks and Assumptions

### Risks
- **Privacy Concerns**: Users may be uncomfortable with persistent memory
- **Context Pollution**: Incorrect or outdated information may persist
- **Performance Impact**: Memory operations may slow down responses
- **Complexity**: System complexity may introduce bugs and maintenance overhead

### Assumptions
- Users want persistent context and are willing to trade some privacy for convenience
- Current Claude Code architecture can be extended to support memory
- File system access is reliable and secure for memory storage
- Users will provide feedback to improve memory accuracy

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement granular privacy controls and transparency
- Provide memory review and editing capabilities
- Optimize memory operations for minimal performance impact
- Start with simple implementation and iterate based on feedback

## Dependencies

- File system access and security framework
- User interface for memory management
- Integration with existing project detection

### External Dependencies
- Reliable file system for persistent storage
- User feedback mechanisms for memory validation
- Potential integration with version control systems
